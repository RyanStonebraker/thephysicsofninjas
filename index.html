                The game works with a series of levels. At the top of the screen
                is the current objective of <br> the ninja and at the bottom is
                an explanation of the physics currently taking place. If the <br>
                current objective is completed, the ninja will move on to the
                next level. If the level is <br> failed, it will restart. Keys
                used to control the ninja will vary on each level and will be <br>
                displayed with the objective.
