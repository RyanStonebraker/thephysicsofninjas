        --><img class = "cntrImg" src="img/ninjateaching.png"></img><p>For my 2016 Physics 211 Project I created a JavaScript game
        featuring a ninja sprite demonstrating physics concepts that utilizes a
        realtime physics engine of which I created specifically for this project
        based off of real kinematic equations. When I started this project I only
         had a couple weeks of self-taught experience with JavaScript and an idea
         for the game, so in order to make my idea a reality, I had to overcome a
         multitude of obstacles as I simultaneously learned JavaScript, Physics,
         and programmed the game. Currently, the game is a little over a total of
         1000 lines of code (equivalent to about 30 pieces of paper if printed with
         size 12 font) and is the largest coding project I have worked on. Not all
         of the features I wanted to include made it into the current version of
         the game due to time and knowledge constraints, however, as mentioned on
         the "sources" page, I have this game available under an MIT open source
         license on my Github page and will continue adding to it when I can.
