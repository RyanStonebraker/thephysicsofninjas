          --><p>The ninja is controlled by holding down the "D" key to move right, "A" key
          to move left, "space" to jump/continue, and the "E" key to use the ninja's
          special ability (if applicable to the level). The current level's objective
          is displayed on top of the physics panel and you have 3 lives to achieve
          the goal by first solving the given problem with the information given and
          then by testing your answer visually by moving the ninja. <b>NOTE: The
          ninja doesn't move at a constant velocity when in contact with ground
          and instead accelerates. Also, the distance displayed near the ninja
          is the X displacement to the very center of the target.</b></p><!--
